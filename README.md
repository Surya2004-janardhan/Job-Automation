# HR Email Sender

This project is designed to send batch emails to a list of HR contacts from an XLSX file. It processes emails in batches of 50, sending BCC emails with a resume attachment, and updates the sent status in the XLSX file.

## Features

- Modularized JavaScript code with async/sync functions
- Batch processing: 50 emails per batch
- BCC sending to avoid recipient visibility
- Resume attachment support
- XLSX file reading and updating
- SMTP configuration for reliable sending

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Place your HR list XLSX file in the root directory (e.g., `hr_list.xlsx`)
3. Place your resume file in the root directory (e.g., `resume.pdf`)
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your SMTP settings
5. Update subject and body in `src/index.js` as needed

### SMTP Configuration

For Gmail, use an app password instead of your regular password to avoid security flags. Enable 2FA and generate an app password.

For better deliverability and to avoid spam flags, consider using a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES. Update the transporter configuration in `scripts/phase3.js` accordingly.

## Usage

Run the main script: `node src/index.js`
